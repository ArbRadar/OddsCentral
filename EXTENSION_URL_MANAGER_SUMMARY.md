# 🗂️ URL Manager System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ **System Overview**

The URL Manager allows users to:
1. **Store sportsbook URLs** from any page with one click
2. **Organize URLs** by sport, league, and custom tags  
3. **Select multiple URLs** for batch scraping operations
4. **Track scraping performance** per URL (success rates, last scraped times)
5. **Manage URL lifecycle** (enable/disable, delete, bulk operations)

## 🏗️ **Database Schema Created**

### **sportsbook_urls** table:
```sql
- id, url, domain, sport, league, market_type
- title, description, tags (array)  
- active, last_scraped, scrape_count, success_count, error_count
- created_at, updated_at, created_by
```

### **batch_scraping_jobs** table:
```sql  
- id, job_name, url_ids (array), status
- started_at, completed_at, urls_scraped, urls_failed
- games_found, odds_found, error_message
```
